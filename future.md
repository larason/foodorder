## FUTURE FEATURES
1. redesign the cart details and replace the cartbottom sheet to a full screen new dedicated cart details screen with a checkout button and a clear cart button, and add a recommendation section to the cart details screen to add more items to the cart(advertised items) also inside food details screen.
* Eventually we will make an app for advertisers to add their drinks or other items to be advertised in the app, and we will charge them a fee for that, but the drink order willbe received by cafe owners and not us, we will just be a platform for advertising and connecting the advertisers to the cafe owners.
